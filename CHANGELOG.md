# Changelog

## v3.2.0 (2026-05-07)

### Consult→Change Handoff — Option C

`/devstarter-consult` now saves the consultation context and offers a direct handoff to `/devstarter-change`, eliminating double-entry of requirements.

**What changed:**
- **`sdlc/devstarter-consult.md`** — Step 4 replaced with "Save Consultation" step:
  - After delivering advice, saves `memory/consult-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[slug].md` using the new intake template
  - `AskUserQuestion` gate: `["save advice only", "implement now", "ask follow-up"]`
  - If "implement now": reads `devstarter-change.md`, skips all intake questions, jumps straight to Impact Analysis
  - If "save advice only": shows file path so user can run `/devstarter-change memory/consult-...md` later (Option B path)
  - If "ask follow-up": re-enters plan mode, loops back after answering
- **`sdlc/devstarter-consult.md`** — Rule 1 updated: one write exception for `memory/consult-*.md` handoff file
- **`templates/intake/devstarter-intake-consult.md`** — new intake template for consultation output; sections: Problem/Request, Analysis Summary, Recommended Approach, Acceptance Criteria

## v3.1.0 (2026-05-07)

### AskUserQuestion at All Gates — Full UX Consistency

All 52 remaining approval gates and mode-picker prompts across every SDLC runbook now use `AskUserQuestion` (arrow-key picker UI) instead of requiring typed input. Users can now select any gate response with arrow keys + Enter throughout the entire DevStarter workflow.

**Files updated:**
- **`agents/shared/devstarter-agent-base.md`** — Gate UX Rule added: `AskUserQuestion` required at every gate in every workflow; standard and release gate patterns documented
- **`sdlc/devstarter-change.md`** — FIRST ACTION picker now uses `AskUserQuestion` (Add / Remove / Fix)
- **`sdlc/devstarter-change-add.md`** — autopilot/manual choice uses `AskUserQuestion`
- **`sdlc/devstarter-change-bug.md`** — Gate C1 uses `AskUserQuestion`
- **`sdlc/devstarter-change-remove.md`** — Gates B1, B2, B3 use `AskUserQuestion`

- **`sdlc/devstarter-retrospective.md`** — Retrospective approval gate uses `AskUserQuestion`
- **`sdlc/devstarter-dependency.md`** — Update approval gate uses `AskUserQuestion`
- **`sdlc/devstarter-document.md`** — FIRST ACTION picker + both document review gates use `AskUserQuestion`
- **`sdlc/devstarter-hotfix.md`** — Gates H1, H2 use `AskUserQuestion`
- **`sdlc/devstarter-rollback.md`** — Gates R0, R1, R2 use `AskUserQuestion`
- **`sdlc/devstarter-gitsetup.md`** — Gate 1 + develop branch protection prompt use `AskUserQuestion`
- **`sdlc/devstarter-migrate.md`** — Gates 1, 2, component approval, Gate 7 cutover use `AskUserQuestion`
- **`sdlc/devstarter-release-prep.md`** — Gate 1 DEV approval uses `AskUserQuestion`
- **`sdlc/devstarter-release-verify.md`** — Gates 2 (SIT), 3 (UAT), 4 (Production deploy) use `AskUserQuestion`
- **`sdlc/devstarter-starter.md`** — FIRST ACTION mode picker uses `AskUserQuestion`
- **`sdlc/devstarter-starter-gates.md`** — Gates 1, 2, 3 (×2), autopilot/manual, Gate 5 use `AskUserQuestion`
- **`sdlc/devstarter-starter-intake.md`** — Both PROJECT SUMMARY approval gates use `AskUserQuestion`
- **`sdlc/devstarter-starter-template.md`** — Revision confirmation + re-approval gate use `AskUserQuestion`
- **`sdlc/devstarter-existing.md`** — FIRST ACTION picker + autopilot/manual choice use `AskUserQuestion`

---

## v3.0.1 (2026-05-07)

### Patch — publish.sh + update.sh migration fix

- **`scripts/publish.sh`** — after overlaying new content onto `_release_clean`, now scans for top-level items present in the release branch but absent from current `main` and removes them; fixes `commands/` persisting in the release repo after v3.0.0 migration
- **`update.sh`** — added v2→v3 migration step: removes `~/.claude/commands/` when `skills/` is present, so existing users get a clean state on next `/devstarter-update`

---

## v3.0.0 (2026-05-07)

### SKILL.md Migration — Native Claude Code Skills Format

**Breaking change** — all 41 commands migrated from flat `commands/devstarter-*.md` to the official Claude Code skills directory format `skills/devstarter-[name]/SKILL.md`. The `commands/` directory is removed. Users upgrading from v2.x must re-run `install.sh` to get the new `~/.claude/skills/` layout.

- **`skills/`** (NEW directory, 41 entries) — each former `commands/devstarter-*.md` is now `skills/devstarter-[name]/SKILL.md`; content unchanged, structure follows Claude Code's official skill discovery pattern
- **`commands/`** (REMOVED) — replaced entirely by `skills/`
- **`install.sh`** — Step 3 updated: `mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills`, copies `skills/` recursively; backup check and item list updated from `commands` → `skills`
- **`update.sh`** — folder loop updated: `commands` → `skills`
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — project structure, naming convention, and one-command rule updated to reflect `skills/devstarter-X/SKILL.md` format

---

## v2.6.0 (2026-05-06)

### Branch Guard — Universal Base Rule

- **`agents/shared/devstarter-agent-base.md`** — Branch Guard section added after Config Guard: all 13 agents now check `git branch --show-current` before touching any file; hard STOP if on `develop`, `main`, `master`, or `uat`; creates `feature/`, `fix/`, or `hotfix/` branch via PROC-GH-06 before proceeding; cannot be skipped in autopilot, resume, or any other context
- **`sdlc/devstarter-hotfix.md`** — Branch Guard warning added at start of PHASE 4 before any code edits
- **`sdlc/devstarter-release.md`** — Branch Guard added before phase sub-file routing to enforce `release/vX.Y.Z` branch for VERSION/CHANGELOG edits
- **`sdlc/devstarter-incident.md`** — Branch Guard added at PHASE 3 Mitigation to block direct file edits on protected branches; routes to `dev-hotfix.md` or `dev-rollback.md` instead
- **`sdlc/devstarter-existing.md`** — Branch Guard added as Rule 10 in Critical Rules section

---

## v2.5.0 (2026-04-24)

### New Command + Branch Guard + Template Sync

- **`commands/devstarter-gitsetup.md`** (NEW) — thin command with inline arg routing: `full` (run all phases), `branches` (create/verify gitflow branches only), `protect` (apply protection only), `labels` (create GitHub labels only); no-arg shows interactive setup plan at Gate 1
- **`sdlc/devstarter-gitsetup.md`** (NEW) — 6-phase idempotent runbook for standalone git + gitflow setup on any existing project; Phase 1: read config, Phase 2: connect/verify remote (PROC-GH-02), Phase 3: create missing `main`/`uat`/`develop` branches + set default branch, Phase 4: apply branch protection (PROC-GH-18 + PROC-GH-10 Step 2), Phase 5: create standard GitHub labels (PROC-GH-04), Phase 6: summary + next steps; safe to re-run on partially configured repos
- **`devstarter-menu.md`** — item 19 "🌿 Git & Gitflow Setup" added under SETUP & INFRA; ML/Utilities section renumbered 20–23
- **`commands/devstarter-registry.md`** — count updated 24 → 25; gitsetup entry added
- **`sdlc/devstarter-change.md`** — Rule 9 (Branch Guard) added to critical rules: `git branch --show-current` check before any file edit; hard STOP if on `develop`, `main`, `master`, or `uat`; applies in autopilot, resume flows, and all other contexts
- **`sdlc/devstarter-change-add.md`** — BRANCH GUARD block added before A-PHASE 5; duplicate step 3 numbering fixed (steps renumbered 1–12)
- **`sdlc/devstarter-change-bug.md`** — BRANCH GUARD added as step 2 in C-PHASE 4; `EnterWorktree`, PROC-GH-07, and `ExitWorktree` steps added (were missing from bug fix flow)
- **`templates/devstarter-config.template.yml`** — synced with v2.4.0+ defaults: added `vcs.uat_branch`, `release_remote`, `upstream_remote`, `branch_protection` block; updated `sync_branches` to `"main uat develop"`; changed `pm.type` default from `notion` → `github-issues`; added full `model_management` section with tier routing for all 25 commands

---

## v2.4.0 (2026-04-23)

### Multi-Remote Release Configuration

- **`devstarter-config.yml`** — added three new fields to the `vcs:` section: `release_remote` (remote name for final main+tag push, e.g. `release` or `origin`), `release_repo` (repo slug on the release remote for Scenario A dual-remote), `upstream_remote` (empty by default, for Scenario C2 fork-based projects)
- **`sdlc/devstarter-release-deploy.md` — Strategy I Step 1** — updated "Auto-detect remote" to "Resolve push remote"; priority order: `devstarter-config.yml release_remote` → git remote auto-detect → `origin` fallback; full copy-paste script updated with same logic
- **`sdlc/devstarter-github.md` — PROC-GH-10** — added Scenario A block at end of protection script: reads `release_remote` + `release_repo` from config; when `release_remote != origin`, applies identical branch protection to `release/main` on the release repo; no-op for Scenario B/C (prints info message instead)

---

## v2.3.1 (2026-04-23)

### Publish Fix — Exclude docs/ and memory/ from Public Release

- **`scripts/publish.sh`** — added `EXCLUDE_FROM_RELEASE=("docs" "memory")` variable; release step now creates a `_release_clean` temp branch from `main`, strips excluded folders, and pushes that to the `release` remote — keeping local `main` intact with dev files while `dev-starter.git` stays clean
- **`scripts/publish.sh`** — removed `git pull release main` (release remote is write-only); local `main` is now merged from `develop` then pushed to `origin/main` independently
- **`docs/management-report.html`** — removed (dev-only document, not needed in repo)
- **`docs/release-v2.3.0.html`** — release notes for v2.3.0

---

## v2.3.0 (2026-04-23)

### Git Branch Strategy — 3-Branch Setup + Protection Rules

- **`sdlc/devstarter-github.md` — PROC-GH-01** — auto-creates 3 branches (`main`, `uat`, `develop`) on new project init; sets `develop` as the GitHub default branch via `gh repo edit --default-branch develop`
- **`sdlc/devstarter-github.md` — PROC-GH-10 Step 1** — standard branch protection for `main` + `uat`: `allow_force_pushes: false`, `allow_deletions: false`, `required_status_checks`, `required_pull_request_reviews` (1 approving review, dismiss stale reviews)
- **`sdlc/devstarter-github.md` — PROC-GH-10 Step 2** (NEW) — optional `develop` branch protection prompted after scaffold at Gate 3; recommended for teams ≥ 3; applies same protection payload as Step 1
- **`sdlc/devstarter-github.md` — PROC-GH-18** (NEW) — idempotent procedure to apply branch protection to existing repos; reads `main_branch` + `uat_branch` from `devstarter-config.yml`; checks branch exists before applying; wired into `/devstarter-existing` Phase 3.5 after PROC-GH-02
- **`sdlc/devstarter-starter-gates.md`** — Gate 0 output updated to show `✅ Branches: main → uat → develop (default ★)` and `✅ Default branch: develop`; Gate 3 completion wired to PROC-GH-10 Step 2 with status line `✅ develop branch: [protected | unprotected]`
- **`sdlc/devstarter-existing.md`** — Phase 3.5 Step 3 (GitHub path): runs PROC-GH-18 after PROC-GH-02; confirms `✅ Branch protection: main + uat — PR required, no force push, no deletion`
- **`templates/CLAUDE.md.template`** — Gate 0 section updated with 3-branch strategy table (main/uat/develop with protection status and flow)
- **`devstarter-config.yml`** — added `uat_branch: uat` field; `sync_branches` updated to `"main uat develop"`
- **`docs/git-workflow.md`** (NEW) — team handoff reference: Branch Overview table, Daily Dev Workflow (feature/* → PR), Head Dev PR review/merge commands, Release Flow (develop→uat→main), Hotfix Flow, Branch Protection Rules table, 7 Key Rules, Quick Reference block

---

## v2.2.0 (2026-04-23)

### Requirement Intake Templates + File-Arg Pattern

- **`templates/intake/devstarter-intake-new-project.md`** (NEW) — 8-section structured PRD template for new projects; covers Project Identity, Target Users, Core Features (MoSCoW), Technical Constraints, NFRs, Success Criteria, Constraints, and Out of Scope; includes INTAKE SUMMARY block for Claude to fill and present for approval before proceeding to Q0-VCS
- **`templates/intake/devstarter-intake-add-feature.md`** (NEW) — 5-section intake for new features; Feature Identity, User Story + Given/When/Then acceptance criteria, Technical Scope (UI/API/DB), Constraints & Boundaries, Priority & Effort; use with `/devstarter-change newfeature.md`
- **`templates/intake/devstarter-intake-modify-feature.md`** (NEW) — 5-section intake for modifying existing features; captures AS-IS vs TO-BE behavior, regression criteria, impact assessment (breaking change flag, UI/API/DB scope), Priority & Effort; use with `/devstarter-change change-login.md`
- **`templates/intake/devstarter-intake-fix-bug.md`** (NEW) — 5-section bug report template; Bug Identity (severity, environment), Reproduction steps, Expected vs Actual + error logs (with sanitize warning for secrets/PII), Context, Fix Acceptance Criteria; use with `/devstarter-change bug-login.md`
- **`sdlc/devstarter-starter-intake.md`** — `## SECTION 0` prepended: (1) file-arg check — if `.md`/`.txt` file passed, read it, extract requirements, show pre-filled INTAKE SUMMARY, wait for approval, go directly to Q0-VCS; (2) inline MODE 3 pre-fill path; (3) interactive section-by-section fallback; answer carry-forward skips Q1, Q2, Q6, Q7 after intake approval
- **`sdlc/devstarter-change-add.md`** — `## A-SECTION 0` prepended: file-arg check with type auto-detection from file content ("AS-IS"/"TO-BE"/"modify" → Modify Feature; "bug"/"error"/"fix"/"broken" → Bug Fix; else → Add Feature); interactive fallback reads matching template; A-PHASE 1 skipped after intake approval; answer carry-forward covers A-Q1 through A-Q8
- **`sdlc/devstarter-change-bug.md`** — `## C-SECTION 0` prepended: file-arg check reads bug report template; C-PHASE 1 skipped after intake approval; answer carry-forward covers C-Q1 through C-Q6
- **`commands/devstarter-new.md`** — File Arg Handling section added before Inline Args: detects `.md`/`.txt` path or file-on-disk arg, reads file, extracts requirements, skips mode-picker + SECTION 0, shows INTAKE SUMMARY for approval; fallback to inline text (MODE 3) if file not found
- **`commands/devstarter-change.md`** — File Arg Handling section added before Inline Args: reads file, auto-detects change type from content keywords, extracts requirements, skips A-SECTION 0 / C-SECTION 0, shows typed INTAKE SUMMARY for approval; fallback to inline text if file not found

---

## v2.1.0 (2026-04-22)

### Multi-VCS + Multi-PM Selection at Project Creation

- **`sdlc/devstarter-starter-intake.md`** — new Q0-VCS + Q0-PM questions added before Q1; user selects VCS (GitHub / GitLab / SVN / None) and PM tool (GitHub Issues / GitLab Issues / Notion / Jira / None) at the very start of every new project; PM auto-suggested based on VCS choice (GitHub → GitHub Issues, GitLab → GitLab Issues, SVN/None → None); answers written immediately to `devstarter-config.yml`
- **`templates/CLAUDE.md.template`** — removed hardcoded `github.com` repository URL and `Notion Board` fields; replaced with `{{REPOSITORY_URL}}`, `{{PM_BOARD_URL}}`, `{{VCS_TYPE}}`, `{{PM_TYPE}}` placeholders; Gate 0 now branches on `vcs.type` and `pm.type` (GitHub → `gh repo create`, GitLab → `glab project create`, SVN → SVN init, None → `git init`; PM setup routes to matching CLI/API per tool); `Notion ↔ GitHub Sync Rules` section renamed to `PM ↔ VCS Sync Rules` covering all PM/VCS combinations
- **`sdlc/devstarter-existing.md`** — Phase 3.5 Step 1 now asks Q0-VCS + Q0-PM when `devstarter-config.yml` does not exist or has placeholder values; Step 3 conditional on `vcs.type` and `pm.type` — routes to `devstarter-github.md`, `devstarter-gitlab.md`, or `devstarter-svn.md` for VCS, and to Notion / `gh` / `glab` / Jira for PM setup

---

## v2.0.1 (2026-04-20)

### Agent Slash Commands — Invoke Any Agent Directly

- **`commands/devstarter-ba.md`** through **`commands/devstarter-mlops.md`** — 13 new slash commands, one per agent; type `/devstarter-ba [task]` to invoke the BA agent directly without going through a workflow
- **`devstarter-menu.md`** — new AGENTS section listing all 13 agent commands for discoverability

---

## v2.0.0 (2026-04-20)

### Native Platform Integration — TaskCreate, AskUserQuestion, agents/custom/, Doctor + Review Commands

- **`sdlc/devstarter-checkpoint.md`** — new Section 1b: `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate` protocol alongside `progress.json`; creates one UI task per SDLC task for session visibility; `TaskUpdate(in_progress)` on start, `TaskUpdate(completed)` on finish; complements cross-session `progress.json` (not a replacement)
- **`sdlc/devstarter-change-add.md`** — Step A4.4: `TaskCreate` for each task after GitHub/Notion creation, stored task IDs used for `TaskUpdate` calls in A5.2; Step A5.2 steps 2 + 8: `TaskUpdate(in_progress)` / `TaskUpdate(completed)` per task
- **`sdlc/devstarter-existing.md`** — Phase 5: `TaskCreate` + `TaskUpdate(in_progress/completed)` alongside Notion/GitHub steps
- **`sdlc/devstarter-sprint.md`** — Phase 4: `TaskCreate` for each sprint item alongside GitHub/Notion creation
- **`sdlc/devstarter-change-add.md`** — `AskUserQuestion` at gates A1, A2, A3, A4 with approve/revise options; interactive gate prompts replace passive text blocks
- **`sdlc/devstarter-existing.md`** — `AskUserQuestion` at analysis confirm, Gate 1 (discovery), and work plan approval
- **`sdlc/devstarter-sprint.md`** — `AskUserQuestion` at Gate S1 sprint scope approval
- **`agents/custom/`** — new folder for user custom agents; preserved by `update.sh` (backup before overwrite, restore after); `install.sh` creates folder on fresh install; `README.md` documents naming convention and usage
- **`commands/devstarter-doctor.md` + `sdlc/devstarter-doctor.md`** — new `/devstarter-doctor` command (#21 in menu); health check for core files, 13+13 agents, 25 commands, key SDLC runbooks, config; outputs ✅/⚠️/❌ per category; Model: Haiku
- **`commands/devstarter-review.md` + `sdlc/devstarter-review.md`** — new `/devstarter-review` command (#22 in menu); 3 modes: PR `#N`, branch name, or current changes; parallel review by @techlead (architecture), @qa (testing), @security (OWASP); outputs 🔴 BLOCKER / 🟡 MAJOR / 🟢 MINOR + verdict; Model: Opus
- **Cleanup:** `agents/teams/` removed (5 files); `sdlc/devstarter-dod.md` merged into `devstarter-checkpoint.md`; `sdlc/devstarter-vcs-common.md` merged into `devstarter-github.md`
- **`setup.sh`** — Q0 name prompt → `devName` in USER.md Identity section; Q2b weak skills field; alias map normalisation (`js→javascript`, `node→node.js`, `azure→cloud`, etc.); `WEAK_LEVEL` auto-calculated one tier below default
- **`sdlc/` 15 runbooks** — Config Guard (`**Config:** Read devstarter-config.yml...`) prepended after `## Model:` header in: audit, autopr, consult, dependency, document, env, handover, incident, ml-workflow, monitor, onboarding, release, retrospective, rollback, sprint

---

## v1.9.0 (2026-04-20)

### Platform Features — Claude Code Native Tool Integration

- **`sdlc/devstarter-change-add.md`** — Step A5.2 now wraps each task's feature branch in `EnterWorktree`/`ExitWorktree` for isolated working copies; prevents dirty state between parallel tasks
- **`sdlc/devstarter-change-add.md`** — Gate A4 autopilot path now calls `PushNotification` before showing the approval prompt; users get a system notification when unattended development completes instead of having to watch the terminal
- **`sdlc/devstarter-consult.md`** — added Step 0: `EnterPlanMode` at consultation start, `ExitPlanMode` after advice delivered; signals to Claude Code that this session is analysis-only
- **`sdlc/devstarter-dependency.md`** — new Phase 1b WebSearch Enrichment step; after local audit, runs `WebSearch` for latest stable version, active CVE IDs (CVSS severity), and breaking changes for every 🔴 Vulnerable and 🟡 Outdated package found

---

## v1.8.1 (2026-04-20)

### Short Agent Aliases — Type @pm Instead of @devstarter-pm

- **`agents/pm.md`, `agents/techlead.md`, `agents/ba.md`, `agents/backend.md`, `agents/frontend.md`, `agents/dba.md`, `agents/qa.md`, `agents/security.md`, `agents/devops.md`, `agents/uxui.md`, `agents/docs.md`, `agents/mobile.md`, `agents/mlops.md`** — 13 thin alias files; each delegates immediately to the full `devstarter-*.md` spec so aliases stay maintenance-free; `install.sh` copies them automatically via existing `agents/*.md` glob
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — agent table updated with Short Alias column; alias file convention documented

---

## v1.8.0 (2026-04-10)

### Model Tier Mapping — Per-Command Model Selection

- **`devstarter-config.yml`** — new `model_management:` section; declares `haiku`, `sonnet`, and `opus` model IDs as the single source of truth; `command_tiers` map lists which commands belong to each tier (5 opus, 12 sonnet, 6 haiku); update model IDs here when Anthropic releases new versions
- **29 SDLC runbooks** — each workflow runbook now opens with a `## Model: [tier] (model-id)` header so users know which Claude model to switch to before running the command
  - **Opus** (5): `audit`, `hotfix`, `incident`, `migrate`, `consult` — deep reasoning, critical production decisions
  - **Sonnet** (19): `change`, `change-add/bug/remove/resume`, `existing`, `release`, `sprint`, `document`, `onboard`, `handover`, `retro`, `dependency`, `rollback`, `monitor`, `autopr`, `ml-workflow`, `ai-providers`, `starter`
  - **Haiku** (5): `env`, `secrets`, `checkpoint`, `config-sync`, `dod` — mechanical, lightweight tasks

---

## v1.7.0 (2026-04-08)

### Autopilot Mode — Extended to Existing + Change Flows

- **`sdlc/devstarter-existing.md`** — new Phase 4.5 autopilot prompt shown immediately after plan approval; `"autopilot"` sets `autopilot_mode=true` + task count in `progress.json`; Phase 5 executes all tasks unattended with silent cron resume; `"manual"` preserves original per-task flow
- **`sdlc/devstarter-change-add.md`** — autopilot prompt added after Gate A3 (GitHub issues + Notion tasks created); `"autopilot"` runs all A-PHASE 5 development tasks unattended; `autopilot_tasks_done` incremented per task; next human interaction is Gate A4 only
- **`sdlc/devstarter-checkpoint.md`** — expanded workflow list to all 7 SDLC runbooks with correct `devstarter-` prefixes; added explicit rule: autopilot resume logic (`paused_limit` → silent, `in_progress` → silent, `waiting_approval` → always wait) applies to **all** workflows, not only `devstarter-starter-gates`

---

## v1.6.1 (2026-04-08)

### Config Auto-Sync — devstarter-config.yml → .project.env

- **`scripts/config-sync.sh`** — new bash script; reads `devstarter-config.yml` and regenerates `.project.env` with all sections; run manually with `bash scripts/config-sync.sh`
- **`scripts/devstarter-config-hook.sh`** — Claude Code `PostToolUse` hook wrapper; detects edits to `devstarter-config.yml` and triggers `config-sync.sh` automatically
- **`.claude/settings.json`** — new project-level Claude Code settings; registers the config-sync hook on `Edit`/`Write` tool use
- **`devstarter-config.yml`** — updated: `pm.type` → `github-issues`, `skill_level` → `expert`, `version` → `1.6.1`
- **`.project.env`** — now fully regenerated by `config-sync.sh`; Notion fields omitted when PM is not `notion`

---

## v1.6.0 (2026-04-08)

### Mandatory devstarter-config.yml — Every Project Must Have One

- **`sdlc/devstarter-starter-gates.md`** — Gate 0 now generates `devstarter-config.yml` from template + syncs `.project.env`; config file is created before any Gate 1 work begins
- **`sdlc/devstarter-existing.md`** — Phase 3.5 promoted to a hard stop: `devstarter-config.yml` must exist on disk before proceeding to work plan; handles both create and update cases
- **`agents/shared/devstarter-agent-base.md`** — new `Config Guard` rule: every agent checks for `devstarter-config.yml` on session start and blocks until it exists
- **`sdlc/devstarter-starter.md`** — Rule 2 "read from disk" now includes `devstarter-config.yml` in the required file list
- **`update.sh`** — post-update check: warns user if current project is missing `devstarter-config.yml` and directs them to `/devstarter-existing`

---

## v1.5.0 (2026-04-08)

### Token Optimization — Leaner Commands, Agents & VCS Runbooks

- **Command routing registry** (`commands/devstarter-registry.md`) — single lookup table for all 24 commands; 16 thin routing files collapsed from 4 lines → 2 lines each
- **Agent boilerplate extracted** — `Progress Reporting` + `Shared Protocols` sections stripped from all 13 agent files into `agents/shared/devstarter-agent-base.md`; net −351 lines across agents
- **VCS common conventions** (`sdlc/devstarter-vcs-common.md`) — branch naming, commit format, .gitignore, labels, semver, and conflict resolution shared across github/gitlab/svn runbooks

### Centralized Config — devstarter-config.yml

- **`devstarter-config.yml`** — new primary config file at project root; replaces `.project.env` as the source of truth
- **`templates/devstarter-config.template.yml`** — full template with all options documented (GitHub/GitLab/SVN, all PM tools, CI, secrets, AI provider)
- **`sdlc/devstarter-config-sync.md`** — Python sync script to auto-generate `.project.env` from `devstarter-config.yml` for bash compatibility
- All 15 SDLC runbooks updated to read `devstarter-config.yml` for project settings

### Proactive Rate-Limit Pause

- **`devstarter-checkpoint.md`** — new `1b. Limit Check` protocol: before each new task, check `tasks_this_session` (≥8) and `files_read_this_session` (≥20) counters
- **`devstarter-agent-base.md`** — `Proactive Rate-Limit Check` section: finish current task → save `paused_limit` → stop → cron auto-resumes with reset counters
- New `paused_limit` status in progress.json: voluntary clean pause, safer than mid-task crash

### Autopilot Mode — Unattended Gate 4 Development

- **`devstarter-starter-gates.md`** — after Gate 3 approval, shows sprint/task summary and offers `"autopilot"` / `"manual"` choice
- `"autopilot"` → runs ALL Gate 4 tasks end-to-end with no user interaction; rate-limit pauses auto-resume via cron; next human interaction is Gate 5 only
- **`devstarter-checkpoint.md`** — `paused_limit` + `autopilot_mode: true` resumes silently; `in_progress` + autopilot also skips resume prompt
- **`devstarter-agent-base.md`** — new `## Autopilot Mode` section: no per-task announcements, silent blocker handling, counter updates, Gate 5 callout on completion

---

## v1.4.1 (2026-04-05)

### New Command: /devstarter-document

Add a standalone document generator command — the 24th slash command.

- **`/devstarter-document`** — generate or regenerate any project document independently,
  without re-running a full gate workflow. Supports 10 doc types:
  `brd`, `srs`, `api`, `schema`, `test`, `security`, `infra`, `prototype`, `plan`, `all`
- Each doc type routes to the correct specialist agent (@devstarter-ba, @devstarter-backend,
  @devstarter-dba, @devstarter-qa, @devstarter-security, @devstarter-devops, @devstarter-uxui, @devstarter-pm)
- Inline args supported: `/devstarter-document api` skips the picker, generates immediately
- Auto-generation during `/devstarter-new` Gate 2 is **unchanged** — this command is additive
- Registered in `devstarter-menu.md` as item 6 under Daily Work (menu renumbered 7–20)

## v1.4.0 (2026-04-05)

### Release: Git Auto-Detection (Strategy I)

- **`/devstarter-release`** — added Strategy I for git-based toolkit/library projects.
  Auto-detects release model at runtime:
  - **Model A** (dual-remote): `release` remote exists → pushes `main` + tag to `release` remote
  - **Model B** (single-repo): no `release` remote → pushes `main` + tag to `origin`
  Includes copy-paste ready `release.sh <version>` script.

---

## v1.3.0 (2026-04-05)

### UX: Quick-Picker First Prompt + Inline Args

Dramatically reduced friction for all intake commands — users no longer
need to answer questions they didn't ask for.

- **`/devstarter-new`** — 3-mode picker shown before any questions:
  Quick (8Q) / Custom (15Q) / Describe (1Q).
  Inline args bypass all questions: `/devstarter-new React todo app` → direct to summary.

- **`/devstarter-change`** — Quick-picker: Add / Remove / Fix.
  Inline args extract type from first word: `/devstarter-change add dark mode` → skip Q1+Q2.

- **`/devstarter-existing`** — Quick-picker: Onboard / Add+Fix / Refactor / Security / Full setup.
  Q3–Q5 (CLAUDE.md, docs/, tech stack) now auto-detected from disk — never asked.
  Inline args set intent directly: `/devstarter-existing onboard me` → scan runs immediately.

- **`/devstarter-audit`** — Quick-picker: 7 audit types + report/plan/fix outcome in one prompt.
  Q1 (project name) and Q5 (environment) auto-detected — never asked.
  Inline args: `/devstarter-audit security` or `/devstarter-audit full audit fix`.

### New VCS Runbooks

- **`sdlc/devstarter-gitlab.md`** — Full GitLab procedure runbook (PROC-GL-01 to GL-17),
  matching `devstarter-github.md` depth. Covers: create repo, MR workflow, branch
  protection, labels, milestones, hotfix, CI/CD pipeline, autonomous MR review via Claude AI.
  Uses `glab` CLI throughout.

- **`sdlc/devstarter-svn.md`** — Full SVN procedure runbook (PROC-SV-01 to SV-13).

- All 23 command files prefixed: `menu.md` → `devstarter-menu.md`, etc.
- All 22 SDLC workflow files prefixed: `dev-starter.md` → `devstarter-starter.md`, etc.
- Team agent files prefixed: `engineering.md` → `devstarter-engineering.md`, etc.

## v1.0.2 (2026-03-23)

### Light Mode Default + Dark Mode Toggle
- **Document Portal** (`templates/docs/index.html`): Redesigned with light mode as default

- Both templates now include a dark mode toggle (sun/moon icon) in the topbar
- Theme preference persisted via `localStorage` and shared between portal and documents
- Mermaid diagrams auto-select light/dark theme based on saved preference

### Change Request Log
- New document: `docs/changerequest-log.html` — tracks all feature additions and removals
- `/devstarter-change` Operation A (Add Feature): now creates a CR entry with ID `CR-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[NNN]`
- `/devstarter-change` Operation B (Remove Feature): now creates a CR entry with removal reason and impact

### Workflow Improvements
- **Notion task status**: Added Rule 5 — tasks MUST update through To Do → In Progress → In Review → Done (all 3 workflows)
- **Continuous development**: Added Rule 6 — after doc approval, develop ALL tasks without per-task stops (all 3 workflows)
- **Parallel execution**: Added Rule 7 — backend + frontend + infra run in parallel when independent (all 3 workflows)
- **Gate 4 rewritten** in dev-starter.md — removed per-feature HARD STOP, added parallel track diagram

### Document Standards
- **Document Portal**: Added Rule 8 — docs/index.html MUST be copied from template, never created from scratch

- **UX/UI agent**: Added mandatory HTML skeleton, concrete Tailwind code examples for Typography, Colors, Buttons, Forms, Data Display, Feedback sections
- **Critical reminders**: Agent explicitly told "NEVER output text descriptions" + "NEVER use ASCII art"

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed: UX/UI prototype produced text descriptions instead of rendered HTML components
- Fixed: Component Library (components.html) was not being created
